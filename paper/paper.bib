abstract = {Solar cells based on quaternary kesterite compounds like Cu2ZnGeSe4are complex systems where the variation of one parameter can result in changes in the whole system, and, as consequence, in the global performance of the devices. In this way, analyses that take into account this complexity are necessary in order to overcome the existing limitations of this promising Earth-abundant photovoltaic technology. This study presents a combinatorial approach for the analysis of Cu2ZnGeSe4based solar cells. A compositional graded sample containing almost 200 solar cells with different [Zn]/[Ge] compositions is analyzed by means of X-ray fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, and the results are correlated with the optoelectronic parameters of the different cells. The analysis results in a deep understanding of the stoichiometric limits and point defects formation in the Cu2ZnGeSe4compound, and shows the influence of these parameters on the performance of the devices. Then, intertwined connections between the compositional, vibrational and optoelectronic properties of the cells are revealed using a complex analytical approach. This is further extended using a machine learning algorithm. The latter confirms the correlation between the properties of the Cu2ZnGeSe4compound and the optoelectronic parameters, and also allows proposing a methodology for device performance prediction that is compatible with both research and industrial process monitoring environments. As such, this work not only provides valuable insights for understanding and further developing the Cu2ZnGeSe4photovoltaic technology, but also gives a practical example of the potential of combinatorial analysis and machine learning for the study of complex systems in materials research.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is rapidly revolutionizing many fields and is starting to change landscapes for physics and chemistry. With its ability to solve complex tasks autonomously, ML is being exploited as a radically new way to help find material correlations, understand materials chemistry, and accelerate the discovery of materials. Here, an in-depth review of the application of ML to energy materials, including rechargeable alkali-ion batteries, photovoltaics, catalysts, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, and superconductors, is presented. A conceptual framework is first provided for ML in materials science, with a broad overview of different ML techniques as well as best practices. This is followed by a critical discussion of how ML is applied in energy materials. This review is concluded with the perspectives on major challenges and opportunities in this exciting field.},

abstract = {Generic, radical technology is of interest because of its potential for value creation across a broad range of industries and applications. Advanced materials ventures are attracted by this opportunity yet face distinctive challenges in commercializing such technology. We explore an anomaly in common assumptions about the commercialization of generic technology. We build on Freeman's concept of technological innovation as a technological and market matching process, on existing literature and on prior experience to build, inductively, a model of the variables influencing value creation by advanced materials ventures. We then test the model on the basis of detailed observation and analysis of two case studies, which have successfully created value through commercialization of advanced materials technology. Extending this theory, we offer managerial and policy recommendations to support value creation by advanced materials ventures.},

@article{Correa-Baena2018,
abstract = {Successful materials innovations can transform society. However, materials research often involves long timelines and low success probabilities, dissuading investors who have expectations of shorter times from bench to business. A combination of emergent technologies could accelerate the pace of novel materials development by ten times or more, aligning the timelines of stake-holders (investors and researchers), markets, and the environment, while increasing return on investment. First, tool automation enables rapid experimental testing of candidate materials. Second, high-performance computing concentrates experimental bandwidth on promising compounds by predicting and inferring bulk, interface, and defect-related properties. Third, machine learning connects the former two, where experimental outputs automatically refine theory and help define next experiments. We describe state-of-the-art attempts to realize this vision and identify resource gaps. We posit that over the coming decade, this combination of tools will transform the way we perform materials research, with considerable first-mover advantages at stake. The development of novel materials has long been stymied by a mismatch of time constants (Figure 1). Materials development typically occurs over a 15-to 25-year time horizon, sometimes requiring synthesis and characterization of millions of samples. However, corporate and government funders desire tangible results within the residency time of their leadership, typically 2-5 years. The residency time for postdocs and students in a research laboratory is usually 2-5 years; when a project outlasts the residency of a single individual, seamless continuity of motivation and intellectual property is often the exception, not the rule. Market drivers of novel materials development, informed by business competition and environmental considerations , often demand solutions within a shorter time horizon. This mismatch in time constants results in a historically poor return on investment of energy-materials (cleantech) research relative to comparable investments in medical or software development. 1 To bridge this mismatch in time horizons and increase the success rate of materials research, both public-and private-sector actors endeavor to develop new paradigms for materials development. 2},

We have discussed the challenges in anticipating the data driven material design.Machine learning (ML) is a field of computer science that uses algorithms and techniques for automating solutions to complex problems that are hard to program using conventional programming methods. Owing to the chemical versatility of organic building blocks, a large number of organic semi-conductors have been used for organic solar cells. Selecting a suitable organic semi-conductor is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Data-driven science, the fourth paradigm of science, has the potential to guide experimentalists to discover and develop new high-performance materials. The last decade has seen impressive progress in materials informatics and data science; however, data-driven molecular design of organic solar cell materials is still challenging. The data-analysis capability of machine learning methods is well known. This review is written about the use of machine learning methods for organic solar cell research. In this review, we have outlined the basics of machine learning and common procedures for applying machine learning. A brief introduction on different classes of machine learning algorithms as well as related software and tools is provided. Then, the current research status of machine learning in organic solar cells is reviewed. We have discussed the challenges in anticipating the data driven material design, such as the complexity metric of organic solar cells, diversity of chemical structures and necessary programming ability. We have also proposed some suggestions that can enhance the usefulness of machine learning for organic solar cell research enterprises.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
